Both countries are into trade and military assistance for a long time now. The bilateral friendly co-operation turned into strategic partnership after the signing of a US $ 46 Billion agreement of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The Corridor is described as the game changer for both countries. The construction is progressing well and covers all areas including energy, finance, information and communication.\n" +
